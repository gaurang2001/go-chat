# Go Realtime Chat

Go is a language used in large networks and distributed systems. The fact that it uses compiler, is much faster than Python and Java and supports concurrency is what makes it suitable for implementing a real-time chat server.

This project implements a multithreaded chat server built from scratch using Golang as a menu-driven program in bash. The goal was to focus on the server-side program so as to completely understand the working of sockets and Goroutines while implementing servers that support multiple clients sending personal messages to each other or broadcast messages to all clients connected to the server.

## Run

> Run a server instance in one terminal window and clients on others

```
go run .
```
